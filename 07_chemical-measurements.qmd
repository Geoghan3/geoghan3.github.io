***Soil pH*** greatly affects which microbial populations
can live in the soil. Soil pH is impacted by inherent qualities of
the soil such as its age, mineralogy, and rainfall zone. It is also impacted by
fertilization, irrigation water pH, and SOM content. Most agricultural crops
grow best in neutral soil pHs, within a range of 6 to 8.

***Total Nitrogen*** is a measurement of both inorganic (plant-available nitrate and ammonium) and organic (typically not plant-available) nitrogen in the soil. Having sufficient total nitrogen in the soil is key for promoting mineralization, or the process of changing the organic nitrogen to a form that plants can use. This was measured with dry, ground soils via dry combustion on a Costech Elemental Analyzer.

***Carbon to Nitrogen Ratio** in agricultural soils in annual systems generally have a C:N ratio of 10:1, which leads to faster cycling of N. This can be ideal for crops when demand for N is high. High C:N ratios tend to lead to N immobilization as microbes consume most of the available N, which can lead to crop deficiencies. Low C:N ratios can lead to harmful losses of N to the environment.
