***Bulk Density*** is the mass of particles within a
certain volume of soil used as an indicator of soil compaction.
We use a bulk density hammer to measure this similar to this:[NRCS
protocol](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/2022-10/Soil%20Bulk%20Density%20Moisture%20Aeration.pdf "NRCS bulk density protocol").

***Infiltration Rate and Unsaturated Hydraulic Conductivity*** (K unsat)
measure the rate at which water enters the soil surface and the ease
with which water is transmitted through the soil, respectively. In
the case of processing tomatoes in Northern California, it may be
particularly important in winter fallowed fields and fields with
furrow irrigation systems. Texture, salinity, plow pans, and soil 
structure drive water movement in the soil. Infiltration is supported
by bioturbation and aggregation by ecosystem engineers
(ants, earthworms, enchytraeids) and plant roots and fungal hyphae.
We measured infiltration rates and K unsat with  (https://metergroup.com/products/mini-disk-infiltrometer/ "mini disk infiltrometers") 
in the field in the Winter of 2024. Some sites were tilled 
before they were dry enough to measure infiltration, and we 
could not report this variable for those fields. Infiltration
rate can be also measured as outlined in this Infiltration rate can be also measured as outlined in this [NRCS protocol](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/2022-10/Infiltration.pdf "NRCS infiltration protocol"). 

***Wet Aggregate Stability*** measures the resistance 
of soil aggregates to disintegration. Aggregates form
when soil particles associate with organic matter,
plant roots, fungal hyphae, and "glues" made by microbes.
Stable aggregates can reduce erosion, and increase
infiltration, drainage, and storage capacity. 
High clay soils tend to have higher aggregate stability,
but increasing soil organic matter improves
aggregate stability across all soil textures.
We measured wet aggregate stability as mean weight diameter (MWD).
This measures the proportion of soil weight that
occurs in different particle size categories
(8 mm - 2 mm, 2 mm - 250 um, 250 um - 52 um, > 52 um)
after exposure to artificial rain. We took air-dried
sieved soils and shook them on a stack of sieves
while rewetting them. We take weights of the soil
in each category to calculate a mean weight diameter.
A higher MWD value means more stable and larger aggregates.

***Water Holding Capacity*** (WHC) varies by soil texture
and bulk density, and can be greatly impacted by management.
Generally, soils with finer textures, high organic matter,
and low bulk density have higher WHC. WHC was measured on
all soil samples by the pressure plates method, and we
calculated it as the difference between field capacity
(FC, water content at a pressure of -10 kPa) and
permanent wilting point (PWP, water content at -1,500 kPa).
