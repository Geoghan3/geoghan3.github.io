***Soil Organic Matter*** (SOM) can be slow to change as the
result of management. Because of this, many other indicators have been developed
to detect more sensitive components in SOM. Keep reading to learn more. SOM was measured by dry combustion. To learn more about how to
increase SOM, read about the [NRCS principles of
building soil health](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/conservation-basics/natural-resource-concerns/soils/soil-health "NRCS principles of building soil health").

SOM underlies many of the benefits and ecosystem services
that soils provide.  However, SOM can be slow to change as the
result of management. Because of this, many other
indicators have been developed to detect more sensitive
components in SOM. Keep reading to learn more.

***Soil organic carbon*** (SOC) represents the carbon tied up in organic matter
and organisms (mainly microbes). This represents the vast majority of the carbon
in your soils. Higher levels of SOC, particularly in the top 12 in of your soil
profile can be thought of as the source of energy for your cropping system. This
was measured with dry, ground soils via dry combustion on a Costech Elemental Analyzer.

***Microbial Biomass Carbon (MBC) and Microbial Biomass Nitrogen (MBN)***
quantify micrograms of carbon and nitrogen contained in the microbes of each
gram of soil. First, we extracted dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON
) from all the samples. On replicated subsamples, we used fumigation with
chloroform to kill all the microbes and have them release all their carbon
and nitrogen. Microbial biomass is the difference between the fumigated samples
and the basal dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen. MBC and MBN are indicators
of easily available carbon and nitrogen, which determines faster cycling of nutrients.

***Potentially Mineralizable Carbon*** (PMC, referred to as "Soil Respiration") 
measures the release of carbon dioxide (CO₂) from soil after soils are rewetted 
in the laboratory under “ideal” conditions after 72hrs. Mineralization refers to the
process in which soil microbes produce CO₂ as they decompose SOM and plant residues.
This process also mineralizes other nutrients, like nitrogen, which can be taken up
by crops. Higher MinC represents greater potential biological activity. Soils with
lower SOM tend to have lower MinC, while compacted soils may not provide adequate
aeration for the mineralization process.

***Phospholipid fatty acids*** (PLFAs) are found in the membranes of living organisms. 
They provide insights on the broad groups of microbes in your soil (e.g. bacteria and fungi)
and total microbial biomass. Higher abundance of fungi can indicate reduced disturbance
and slower but more efficient carbon and nutrient cycling, whereas the opposite is
generally true for bacteria. A higher fungi:bacteria ratio can signify more efficient
carbon and nutrient cycling of the microbial community. Higher biomass is a positive
sign for improved ecosystem function. Similarly a higher score on the diversity index
is a positive for ecosystem function

***Nematodes community***  identification and quantification of nematodes is an indicator
of the status of the ecological networks within a field. The analysis consists of extracting,
concentrating, and counting up to 200 nematodes from a fresh soil subsample under a microscope.
We analyzed only the 6-12 inch depth samples, because nematodes move towards moist soil.
For this indicator, you will find specific genre quantification, its feeding habits, and a
summary of the percentage of herbivores, fungivores, and bacterivores nematodes. The genre
of particular concern for tomato growers is Meloidogyne or root-knot nematode. For more information please visit
this UC ANR webpage and root knot nematodes [root knot nematodes] (https://ipm.ucanr.edu/agriculture/tomato/root-knot-nematodes/#gsc.tab=0 "root knot nematodes"). 
If you need more information about any of the nematode’s indicators, please let us know or visit Nemaplex (http://nemaplex.ucdavis.edu/Uppermnus/topmnu.htm).
